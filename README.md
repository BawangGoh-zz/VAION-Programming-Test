# VAION Programming-Test

* General: This folder contain general programming problems and code written in C++11.
  * Question_1: Calculated sum of the first 100 even-valued Fibonacci number
  * Question_2: Passed 2 sorted array of integers return an array of unique elements
  * Question_3: Passed passed a positive integer returns true if the decimal representation of that integer contains no odd digits and otherwise 
                returns false
  * Question_4:  passed a decimal digit X, returns the value of X+XX+XXX+XXXX e.g (3+33+333+3333 = 3702)

* Java: This folder contain Java programming problems and code written in Java 13.
  * Question_1: Implement doubly linked list which allows new integers to be added to either end of the list, any referenced node to be removed, 
                and the ﬁrst and last integers to be read quickly
  * Question_2: Passed a string containing a mixture of bracket characters - i.e. ‘{‘, ‘}’, ‘[‘, ‘]’, ‘(‘ and ‘)’, returns true if the brackets 
                in the string are correctly balanced, and false otherwise
 
* Python: This folder contain Python programming problems and code written in Python 3.7
  * Question_1: Define a generator which generates the positive integers up to and including a supplied value which are divisible by another 
                supplied positive integer and use it to calculate the sum of all positive integers less than 102030 which are divisible by 3
  * Question_2: Write a function which is passed an integer, n,  and returns a list of n lists such that <br> 
                f(0) return [], <br>
                f(1) return [[1]], <br>
                f(2) return [[1], [1,2]], <br> 
                f(3) return [[1], [1,2], [1,2,3]]
